## Dockerfile for Create-elm-app

Dockerfile for [create-elm-app](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app) for use in a CI.

## Why?
Version I historically needed was not available on Docker hub.

## Stuck on Elm v0.18?
Use the `v1.10.4` version on docker hub: `docker pull cortisol/create-elm-app:v1.10.4`

## Credits
Thanks to [norpan](https://github.com/norpan) for his original dockerfile.
